      <H3> Hello ! So glad you stopped by !</H3>
       I’m Kavya a freelance illustrator based in Bangalore.
      I create art around things that touch my heart and soul.My work is inspired by nature,
      nostalgia, relationships and emotions <br /><br />

      I am a self taught illustrator . While I studied Computer science engineering I was
      introduced to graphic design which lead me exploring more about visual arts.
      I am always up for taking meaningful illustration courses to upgrade my skills .
      It all started 7 years ago as a hobby and not giving up on it lead to working as a
      freelance illustrator.  Apart from freelance work I have also gained 5+ years of
      experience as a computer science lecturer and successfully taught web designing
      and programming to undergrads.
<br /> <br />
      When I am not drawing, you can find me cooking, listening to my favourite music,
      watching  re-runs of Dexter’s Laboratory , Klaus , Up , In this corner of
      the world , Young Sheldon , BBT , Sherlock Holmes , Harry Potter , etc or you
      can see me with a canon camera clicking pictures of cute animals or candid
      shots of random people.
